# MaterialsPage
Project: Improve the UX and Design of the below part of http://ui.telerikacademy.com:

 Materials:
    Each materials page must show demos, slides, videos
    Example: merge the following pages:
        Slides page: http://ui.telerikacademy.com/Courses/LectureResources/Presentation/9107
        Videos page: http://ui.telerikacademy.com/Courses/LectureResources/Video/9113
    Better UX and design of the Navigation
    Better and more beautiful way to show urgent messages to users
        Examples: "Трябва да си изберете група", "Имате нови приятелства"
    Both for public and authenticated users
 ------------------
Task 1: UX

    Improve the user experience of part of http://ui.telerikacademy.com
        Improve user interaction
        Improve information architecture
        Improve the UX for mobile devices

Task 2: Design

    Build a new design based on http://ui.telerikacademy.com
        You can reuse existing components
        You must limit to the colors from this palette

Task 3: Prototype

    Create a simple static prototype using HTML & CSS


UX Design

    Requirements
        For each of the tasks you should use the style guide provided in the folder StyleGuide.psd/StyleGuide.png
        Define the goal of the pages you are about to design. List all goals if more than one and order them by priority.
        Based on the goal in p.1, create a workflow diagram showing the tasks a user must accomplish within the system. Tasks must be in a sequential order, grouped by scenarios if more than one is available. Show conditional logic if available – e.g. if user is logged or not logged.
        Structure and mock up the main site navigation, including the fly-out menus (if you use ones). Consider a specific layout for the responsive view for mobile.
        Create low fidelity wireframes for the pages and link them together in a prototype. Consider responsive layout rearrangement for mobile. You can use a prototyping tool of your choice (e.g. Axure, UXPin, InVision, Balsamiq, Justinmind, other; or plain HTML; or even paper prototypes that are scanned and linked together).
        Your wireframes, and particularly your final project, must comply with the 10 usability heuristics. The more boxes you check - the better. Apply techniques discussed during the lectures for information architecture, interaction design, UI design, mobile design.

UX Task Deliverables

    A short summary of the goal of the designed pages
    A workflow diagram
    Low-fidelity wireframes stitched in a clickable prototype, including the main navigation. Draft the layout for the navigation in mobile too.

Criteria

    Whole project
        A straightforward and understandable user flow.
        Clear information architecture, visible through the main navigation. Navigation is displayed in a usable way for mobile.
        Clear labels and microcopy.
        Consider responsive layout rearrangement for mobile.
        Clear affordance for the elements – e.g. buttons, links, etc. Displayed interaction states of the elements and screens.
        Clear primary actions for the pages or page sections.
        Low interaction cost.
    Photoshop files
        Correct unit type must be used e.g. pixels
        Files must be well organized and structured e.g. proper layer names; good use of groups
        Use layer comps, if applicable
        Try to use layers based on types e.g. fill of gradient layers instead of raster layer with color overlay / gradient overlay
    Prototypes
        Not built with tables
        Built without using absolute position (absolute position can be used, but not for everything)
        Responsive means having one page that adapts, no several showing different viewports
